# AnimacionesConJS

This repository contains exercises from the "Lógica de programación: Practicando con juegos y animaciones" course, where we practiced creating games and animations using JavaScript.

## Exercises

### 1. Drawing a Face

In this exercise, we learned how to use the `canvas` element and JavaScript functions to draw a face. We practiced creating shapes, setting colors, and positioning elements on the canvas.

### 2. Drawing a Tool

In this exercise, we built on what we learned in the previous exercise and created a more complex drawing using the `canvas` element and JavaScript functions. We practiced using loops to create repeating patterns and setting up event listeners to detect user input.
